# Random Forest Classifier for Customer Data

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Random Forest Classifier** applied to customer data stored in the `customer.csv` file. The goal is to classify customer attributes and predict a target variable based on their features using a machine learning model.

## Files in this Repository

- `customer.csv`: This CSV file contains customer data with various attributes that will be used for training the Random Forest model.
- `RandomForest.ipynb`: A Python script that implements the Random Forest Classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## What is Random Forest?

Random Forest is a popular ensemble learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by creating a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode (classification) or mean (regression) prediction of the individual trees.

### Key Features of Random Forest:
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines the results from multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.
- **Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)**: Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data, which helps reduce variance and improve the robustness of the model.
- **Feature Importance**: Random Forest provides insights into which features are most important for making predictions.
